1.  Introduction

   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) is a mainstream layer 1 technology
   for the transport network.  Over the years, it has continued to
   evolve, to improve its transport functions for the emerging
   requirements.  The topology and tunnel information in the OTN has
   already been defined by generic traffic-engineering models and
   technology-specific models, including [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang]
   and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-tunnel-model].

   In the latest version of OTN, ITU-T G.709/Y.1331 Edition 6.5
   [ITU-T_G.709], the fine grain OTN (fgOTN) is introduced for the
   efficient transmission of low rate client signals (e.g., sub-1G).

   This document presents the control interface requirements of fgOTN,
   and defines two YANG data models for fgOTN topology and fgOTN tunnel.
   The topology model can capture topological and resource-related
   information pertaining to fgOTN.  The fgOTN tunnel YANG data model
   defined in this document is used for the provisioning and management
   of fgOTN Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels and Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs).

   Furthermore, this document also imports the generic Layer 1 types
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-layer1-types].

   The YANG data models defined in this document conform to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Fine grain Optical Transport Network Scenarios Overview

   OTN network will cover a larger scope of networks, it may include the
   backbone network, metro core, metro aggregation, metro access, and
   even the OTN CPE in the customers' networks [ITU-T_G.709.20].  In
   general, the metro OTN networks support both fgODUflex and ODUk
   switching.  At the boundary nodes (e.g., metro-core nodes) of the
   metro OTN networks, the fgODUflexes to other metro OTN networks are
   multiplexed into ODUk of backbone networks.  Therefore, the backbone
   OTN network could only support ODUk switching.

   The typical scenarios for fgOTN is to provide low bit rate private
   line or private network services for customers.  The interface
   function requirements of fgOTN mainly include topology resource
   reporting and service provisioning.  Three scenarios that require
   special consideration are listed based on the characteristics of
   fgOTN.

2.1.  Retrieve Server Tunnels Scenario of fgOTN

   Figure 1 below shows an example of scenario to retrieve server
   tunnels for multi-domain fgOTN service.  In this example, some small
   bandwidth fgOTN service are aggregated by the access ring (10G), and
   then aggregated into a bigger bandwidth in metro ring (100G).  The
   allocation of TS to support fgOTN switching maybe different in access
   ring and metro ring.  All link bandwidth information that supports
   fgOTN should be reported to MDSC by the PNC controller.  E.g. there
   could be three ODU0 allocated in the access ring while there could be
   two ODU2 are allocated in the metro ring to support fgOTN switching.
   In this example, the server layer ODUk tunnel for fgOTN tunnel from
   node A to node E is ODU0, and the server layer tunnel from node E to
   node G is ODU2.  The server layer tunnel for fgOTN tunnel will
   include one ODU0 tunnel and one ODU2 tunnel.

            Figure 1: The Scenario to Retrieve Server Tunnels

2.2.  Multi-layer Path Splicing Scenario of fgOTN

   Some operators that would like to provide the paths when there could
   be different switching capabilities of nodes in their LSP, so that
   the MDSC coordinator can clearly display multi-layer paths and the
   relationship between primary-path and secondary-path.  In the current
   network, not all nodes in the operator network support fgOTN, as
   shown in figure 2, node f1, f2, f3 and f4 support fgOTN, node N-f5
   and node N-f6 do not support fgOTN.  To present the end-to-end multi-
   layer primary-path and secondary-path of the services on the client
   side, it is necessary to complete the end-to-end path splicing based
   on the the ODU tunnel information associated with the fgotn tunnel.

   In Figure 2, assuming that the server layer ODUk tunnel for the fgOTN
   primary tunnel from node f1 to node f2 is ODU0, the server layer
   tunnel from node f2 to node f3 is ODU2, and the server layer tunnel
   from node f3 to node f4 is ODU1.  Assuming the server layer ODUk
   tunnel for the fgOTN secondary tunnel from node f1 to node f2 is
   ODU2.  We need to setup four server layer ODUk tunnels before setting
   up an fgODUflex tunnel with a primary path and a secondary path to
   provide protection.  To support multi-layer path splicing, we should
   make some extension on the dependency tunnel structure or on the path
   element, such as extending the working roles and index of the
   tunnels.

2.3.  Hitless Bandwidth Adjustment Scenario of fgOTN

   [ITU-T_G.709] defines the data plane procedure to support fgODUflex
   hitless resizing.  The support of management of hitless resizing of
   fgODUflex needs to be carefully considered.

   The range of fgOTN service's Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) cannot exceed
   its server layer's bandwidth.

   The client needs to know how many bandwidth of a link is allocated
   for fgOTN.  When performs hitless resizing, the client sends the
   fgODUflex identifier and the target bandwidth to the source node
   controller.  After receiving the network management configuration
   information, the source node triggers the bandwidth adjustment.
   During the hitless bandwidth adjustment process, it is necessary to
   reserve or mark the corresponding bandwidth resources first, and then
   trigger the the bandwidth adjustment actions.

   Another point to note is that when performing bidirectional hitless
   resizing for fgODUflex service, the adjustment should be initiated by
   the client side to a single network management system.  Specifically,
   the adjustment is first performed in the Node 1 to Node 6 direction,
   and then the reverse direction (Node 6 to Node 1) is automatically
   triggered for adjustment.

   Both single domain and multi-domain hitless resizing should be
   supported.  For multi-domain hitless resizing scenario, both the
   source controller and the destination controller should report the
   bandwidth adjustment status to the MDSC coordinator upon completion.

3.  YANG Data Model for fine grain Optical Transport Network Overview

   In order to provide fgOTN capabilities, this document defines two
   extension YANG data models augmenting to OTN topology and OTN tunnel
   YANG model.  The attributes related to fgOTN are augments from OTN
   topology data model, and fgOTN topology is not treated as a separate
   hierarchy.  The fgOTN tunnel is defined as a separate tunnel
   hierarchy, and the fgOTN tunnels need to be pre-set and created
   before the service provisioning process.

4.  YANG Data Model for fgOTN Topology

4.1.  Fine Grain OTN Topology Data Model Overview

   This document aims to describe the data model for fine grain OTN
   topology.  The YANG module presented in this document augments from
   OTN topology data model, i.e., the ietf-otn-topology, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang].  In section 6 of
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang], the guideline for augmenting OTN
   topology model was provided, and in this draft, we augment the OTN
   topology model to describe the topology characteristics of fgOTN.

   Common types, identities and groupings defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-layer1-types] is reused in this document.

   [RFC8345] defines an abstract (generic, or base) YANG data model for
   network/service topologies and inventories, and provides the
   fundamental model for [RFC8795].  OTN topology module in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang] augments from the TE topology YANG
   model defined in [RFC8795].  Figure 4 shows the augmentation
   relationship.

    Figure 4: Relationship between fgOTN topology and OTN topology model

   The entities, TE attributes and OTN attributes, such as nodes,
   termination points and links, are still applicable for describing an
   fgOTN topology and the model presented in this document only
   specifies technology-specific attributes/information.  The fgOTN-
   specific attributes including the fgTS, can be used to represent the
   bandwidth and label information.  At the same time, it is necessary
   to extend the encoding and switching-capability enumeration values in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc8776-update] to identify that the current Tunnel
   Termination Point (TTP) is a termination point of an fgOTN tunnel.

4.2.  Bandwidth Augmentation

   Based on the OTN topology model, we augment the bandwidth information
   of fgOTN, including the max-link-bandwidth and unreserved-bandwidth.
   The augmented parameter fgotn-bandwidth is used to indicate how much
   of the bandwidth has been allocated for the usage of fgOTN.  For
   example, if 2 ODU0s are allocated to support fgOTN switching
   switching, the fgotn-bandwidth is 2500, and the unit is Mbps.

   augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link/tet:te/tet:te-link-attributes
             /tet:max-link-bandwidth/tet:te-bandwidth/otnt:otn-bandwidth
             /otnt:odulist:
      +--rw fgotn-bandwidth?   uint16

   The augmented fgotnlist structure is used to describe the unreserved
   TE bandwidth of fgOTN in the server ODUk.  The odu-ts-number is used
   to indicate the index of server ODUk channel.

   augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link/tet:te/tet:te-link-attributes
             /tet:unreserved-bandwidth/tet:te-bandwidth
             /otnt:otn-bandwidth:
      +--rw fgotnlist* [odu-type odu-ts-number]
         +--rw odu-type           identityref
         +--rw odu-ts-number?     uint16
         +--rw fgotn-bandwidth?   uint16

4.3.  Label Augmentation

   The model augments the label-restriction list with fgOTN technology-
   specific label information using the otn-label-range-info grouping
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-layer1-types].

   augment /nw:networks/tet:te/tet:templates/tet:link-template
           /tet:te-link-attributes/tet:label-restrictions
           /tet:label-restriction/otnt:otn-label-range:
      +--rw fgts-range* [odu-type odu-ts-number]
         +--rw odu-type           identityref
         +--rw odu-ts-number?     uint16
         +--rw fgts-reserved?     string
         +--rw fgts-unreserved?   string

   The fgts-range list is used to describe the availability of fgOTN
   timeslot in the server ODUk, including the fgts-reserved and fgts-
   unreserved.  The odu-ts-number is used to indicate the index of
   server ODUk channel.

5.  YANG Data Model for fgOTN Tunnel

5.1.  Fine Grain OTN Tunnel Data Model Overview

   This document aims to describe the data model for fgOTN tunnel.  The
   fgOTN tunnel model augments to OTN tunnel
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-tunnel-model] with fgOTN-specific parameters,
   including the bandwidth information and label information.  Figure 5
   shows the augmentation relationship.

                  +-------------------+

         Figure 5: Relationship between fgOTN and OTN tunnel model

   It's also worth noting that the fgOTN tunnel provisioning is usually
   based on the fgOTN topology.  Therefore the fgOTN tunnel model is
   usually used together with fgOTN topology model specified in this
   document.  The OTN tunnel model also imports a few type modules,
   including ietf-layer1-types and ietf-te-types.

   A new identity based on odu-type should be defined for fgODUflex in
   an updated version of [I-D.ietf-ccamp-layer1-types] to indicate the
   bandwidth of fgotn tunnel.

5.2.  Bandwidth Augmentation

   The model augment TE bandwidth information of fgOTN tunnel.

   augment /te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel/te:te-bandwidth/te:technology
           /otn-tnl:otn:
      +--rw fgoduflex-bandwidth?   string

   The string value fgoduflex-bandwidth is used to indicate the
   bandwidth of this fgOTN tunnel.

5.3.  Label Augmentation

   The module augments TE label-hop for the explicit route objects
   included or excluded by the path computation of the primary-paths and
   secondary-paths using the fgts-numbers.  The fgts-numbers is used to
   specify fgTS information on inter-domain ports of the routing path.
   When specifying the fgotn time slot in the routing constraint
   information, the ODU time slot must also be specified.  We also
   augment the TE label-hop for the record route of the LSP using the
   fgts-numbers.

Appendix B.  Appendix A.  Multi-domain fgOTN Hitless Resizing Process

   The process of cross domain hitless resizing include six steps.  Both
   the source and destination controllers should report the hitless
   bandwidth adjustment status to the MDSC coordinator.

   Step 1: The MDSC coordinator sends an resizing command to the source
   node (Node1) via Controller 1.  The command includes the target
   bandwidth and the fgODUflex service identifier.

   Step 2: Controller 1 reports the bandwidth adjustment status ietf-te-
   types:lsp-path-modifying to the MDSC via notification.

   Step 3: After the resizing in the direction from Node1 to Node6 was
   completed, Controller 1 reported ietf-te-types:lsp-path-modified to
   MDSC.  This automatically triggered a reverse-direction resizing
   (Node6 to Node1).

   Step 4: Once the reverse resizing begins, Controller 3 reports the
   bandwidth adjustment status to the MDSC via notification.

   Step 5: After the reverse direction (Node 6 to Node 1) resizing is
   completed, Controller 3 reports ietf-te-types:lsp-path-modified to
   MDSC.

   Step 6: All domain controllers, including the intermediate domain
   Controller 2, report notifications of topology and tunnel resource
   changes to MDSC coordinator.
