Since some people are not so familiar with this new draft, so Chaode presented the presentation slide of IETF 120 again to introduce the motivation of this work and what have been extented in the current draft.

Gert: It is suggested to call fgOTN as a new type of ODU. It will be muddy to discuss layer both in ITU-T and IETF.

Action Point:
Yanxia is going to prepare a slide or some other material to introduce the use cases of fgOTN and will present it in the next call.
