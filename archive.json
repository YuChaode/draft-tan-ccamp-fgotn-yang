We found it is a generic requirement, not only for fgOTN, but also for the other layers. we can describe the current standard solution and our concerns, and provide two options: extension on the dependancy tunnel, and extension on the path element. )\n2). we have discussed how to filer the TP which can support fgOTN. The current solution in our draft is one extension attribute under the termination poin.(fgOTN-supported?) We didn't make agreement on this solution. And one possible solution is to make some extension on switching-capability and encoding. But there could be some impact on PCEP and GMPLS protocol, we would like to seek some helps from the experts on this domain. Maybe we need to have some collaboration with Lin Yi's draft and it seems that we need a new signal type.\n3). We have discussed the link's bandwidth which can support fgOTN.

In a new `fgotn-types` YANG module within this draft\n2.

Investigate the impact of defining a new odu-type with the existing OTN topology and OTN tunnel model\n1. Check with CCAMP and PCEP mailing lists that the proposed approach is agreed for GMPLS, PCEP and YANG\n1. Decide where to define the new odu-type identity\n",

Therefore:\r\n\r\n- A single network topology instance is used to report both OTN and fgOTN topology information: fgOTN technology-specific attributes are therefore defined in the fgOTN topology model as augmentations of the OTN topology model, but without defining a new network type for fgOTN.\r\n\r\n- The OTN tunnel model can be used to setup either an OTN or an fgOTN tunnel: fgOTN technology-specific attributes are therefore defined in the fgOTN tunnel model as augmentations of the OTN tunnel model, which are applicable only when the OTN tunnel is an fgOTN tunnel.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to describe that the same switching-type and encoding types can be used for ODUk and fgODUflex and therefore that a new odu-type value shall be defined by I think it is too early. We can update this text when we have agreed on this point",
